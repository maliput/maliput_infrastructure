# dsim-repos-index

This repository contains basic workspace infrastructure for dsim repositories.

## Where is my README?

As part of #182, the README was migrated to [maliput-documentation](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/maliput-documentation/blob/main/docs/installation_quickstart.rst).

## Where is my old and deprecated README?

There was a time, an ancient time where a different workflow was used. In PR #XX it got removed. You could visit it, but please don't. You should not use it anymore.
