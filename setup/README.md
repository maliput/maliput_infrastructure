# Maliput Workspace Setup

## Supported platforms

* For regular workspaces, only Ubuntu Bionic Beaver 18.04 LTS is supported as host OS.

* For dockerized workspaces, only Nvidia powered machines are supported as host machines.

## Prerequisites

* To get all necessary scripts and repos files, clone this repo locally at some path.

* To actually use the scripts, make sure you have the following packages installed:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-jinja2
sudo apt install pciutils
```

* To pull private repositories, the current user default SSH keys will be used (and thus assumed as both necessary and suficient for the purpose).

* Dockerized workspaces require *nvidia-docker2*, so make sure you have an NVIDIA card and the drivers installed.
You can check out [nvidia-docker2 installation instructions](https://github.com/nvidia/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0)) if needed
* On Ubuntu Xenial hosts, you may also need to install docker from their repository. Instructions can be found

## Basic setup

To setup a regular workspace, run:

```sh
path/to/dsim-repos-index/setup/setup_workspace path/to/my/workspace
```

To setup a dockerized workspace, run:

```sh
path/to/dsim-repos-index/setup/setup_dockerized_workspace path/to/my/workspace
```
Note: Docker image will be called maliput-devel:<unix_timestamp>, we decided to use a unix timestamp as a tag so we can create as many docker images we want whenever we run the above command without worrying that we could potentially overwrite something. Below it's explained how to update your docker image.

Both operations will setup a `colcon` like workspace that uses binaries for
upstream dependencies whenever possible.

To bring up any of these workspaces, run:

```sh
source path/to/my/workspace/bringup
```

You can always leave the workspace by `exit`ing it.

## Advanced setup

None of the basic setup scripts described so far actually build up a workspace, but rely
on another script that is generated from proper default options. These options, however,
are not the only possible combinations available but just the most commonly used ones.

You can check all available workspace options by running:

```sh
path/to/dsim-repos-index/setup/generate_setup_script -h
```

The output of this script is pure bash code that can be verified, modified and executed. It
is also self contained and thus portable.

## How to build your workspace

1. Make sure you `source bringup`.

2. Once you are sitting in the workspace, run the following if you are using **drake's binary**

```sh
colcon build
```
If you are using **drake's source** then run:
```sh
colcon build --cmake-args -DWITH_PYTHON_VERSION=3
```

3. Finally, run
```sh
source install/setup.bash
```

**Note:** We recommend you to run `delphyne-gazoo` and `delphyne-mali` (type them on your terminal) to see if everything is working properly.

## How to build and run tests

At the moment tests are built by default, so once colcon finishes building, you can run
```sh
colcon test --event-handlers=console_direct+ --return-code-on-test-failure --packages-skip PROJ4
```

## How to update your workspace

If you want to update your workspace, you have to do the following:

1. Go to your workspace
2. Run
```sh
source bringup -u /path/to/dsim-repos-index
```
Note: You should **update your dsim-repos-index local repository** and you need to provide the **full path to the dsim repository** to the -u option. This will **increase
your docker image size** because it will commit the image with the new changes.
Also, we **don't recommend you to update your workspace using this command** if you decided to customize your setup instead of using **setup_dockerized_workspace** or **setup_workspace**
